# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?  I spent 2 days working on this project.
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?  The most rewarding challenge was making the filter work.
3. What two additional features did you build? Why? I used Terminal Table to 'pretty' up the lists, because using terminal is fairly vanilla and I wanted to spice my project up a bit.
